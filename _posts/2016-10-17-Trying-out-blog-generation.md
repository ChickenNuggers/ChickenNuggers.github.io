title: Trying out blog generation
layout: post
---
So this is my first blog post. I'm really not used to writing these but since
some people like blogs I guess I'll make one. I'm Charles. I also go by Ryan,
my "preferred" but not legal name. I'm a software and web developer who works
dual stack &mdash; I program for both the frontend of an application (usually a
website but sometimes also a native program) and the backend. I have experience
in Python, Lua, JavaScript, C++, C, and a few other languages. I'm also a
system administrator for Hashbang, Inc.

For fun, I like to watch YouTube videos or program to some nice ambient music.
I also like playing games but - at the moment - don't have a gaming rig to play
on (and on that topic, if anyone wants to donate one, feel free). I also enjoy
networking with other people on IRC.

As of last week, I've moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in hopes of finding a
job. Once I do, I hope that I can stay here and help be an innovator of new
technology. I like being in the middle of where things "happen" because it's
what I like to integrate into my lifestyle.

I'm not really sure how to end these things off.
